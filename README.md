# Hi there 
# I'm Eric Jensen, a junior attendee at Old Dominion University (ODU). 
# Currently, I am continuing to use this account for my college course to assist my programming and have a spot to put what I work on. 
# I'm currently learning Unity, both simple and complex code. 
# Fun Fact, I have an old cat I saved on a bridge a year ago! Her name is Stormy.
